## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Transient Nature:** These email addresses are temporary. Do not use them for critical accounts (like banking) that may require long-term access.
* **Automatic Reset:** Clearing your browser cache or letting the timer expire will result in the loss of the current session and the generation of a new address.
